                <p>I am a videographer, editor, and web developer looking to expand my skills and work on new and different

                <h3>Rutgers University</h3>
                <h4>Videographer and Editor</h4>
                <p>Working for Rutgers University Sports Department, I was in charge of producing video segments to be shown
                    online and in-person so as to represent the University and department. I worked often as part of a small
                    team that I was in charge of, and was tasked with covering all steps of production from idea synthesis
                    and pre-production through filming and eventually post-production. I handled post-production work on
                    my own, but worked as a team in many different roles especially while filming. This proved to be a great
                    work experience as I developed a diverse set of skills so that I feel comfortable in many aspects of
                    film production, while still carving out a niche for myself in post-production work.

                <h4>Film Intern</h4>
                <p>I served as the second level of judgement for submitted films into the New Jersey International Film Festival.
                    As interns we viewed the submitted feature films and shorts, that come from all over the world in all
                    languages, and produced a written rating and review to argue either for or against the film's merit as
                    per gaining entrance into the festival. I also assisted in various duties and helped run the film festival
                    screenings themselves, including meeting and managing filmmakers and actors. The internship put an emphasis
                    on our abilities as film scholars as well as our taste and vision in our field.
